1. GIM data structure definition of the illustrative case, as show in Figure 13 in the manuscript. 
Evaluation of topology optimization results for strut-and-tie modeling of reinforced concrete.
Input: Topology optimization results.
Output: Truss-like structure and three evaluation indexes. TRS,SR and STS index are three indexes for evaluating truss-like models.
TRS index: Tensile region similarity index, tensile stress fields of the original structure and TO results are compared.
SR index: Steel reinforcement ratio, the SR ratio is calculated as the volume fraction of steel with respect to the concrete volume.
STS index: Suitable truss structure index, it measures the degree to which the obtained truss-like structure.
